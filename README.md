## How to Deploy the App

### 1. **Build the App for Production**

To deploy your app, first build it for production:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This creates a `build` directory containing optimized production files.

### 2. **Choose a Hosting Provider**

You can host your app on several platforms. Some common options include:

- **Vercel**: Fast and easy deployment, especially for React apps.
- **Netlify**: Simple to deploy and offers continuous integration.
- **GitHub Pages**: A free and straightforward way to host static sites directly from your GitHub repository.

#### Deploying on Vercel or Netlify

1. Create a new project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. Link the repository to the hosting provider.
3. Push your changes to GitHub, and the deployment will automatically start.

## How the App Works

### Search for Books
- Users can enter a search term in the search bar.
- The app will query the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) and display the results, including the book title, author(s), and an image thumbnail.
- If the user clicks on a book, they can view a detailed preview by clicking on the "View Preview" link, which takes them to the bookâ€™s page on Google Books.

---

## Future Improvements

- Implement pagination for the search results to load more books.
- Add a favorites feature to allow users to save their preferred books.
- Improve error handling and loading states for a smoother user experience.
- Add user authentication for a more personalized experience.
